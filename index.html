            <h3>Aim and Objective</h3>
            <p class="bodytext">Computational Science is the study of addressing problems that are impossible to solve (or difficult to solve) without computing support. The field is interdisciplinary by nature and includes the use of advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. In short, Computational Science is the science of using computers to do science. <br>

Computational techniques enables simulation of natural phenomena at different scales. Such multi-scale, multi-level simulations have enabled many recent discoveries leading to better understanding of the nature. There is a strong need to pursue this path of doing science, the third pillar of scientific investigations. Computational Science also involves the application of data-analytics tools and algorithms, mathematical modelling and simulation techniques to the study of natural phenomena. <br>

Computational Intelligence which is the study of computational methods in ways that exhibit intelligence and methods that adapt to changing environments and changing goals is another area of interest to do Computational Science. High performance computing (HPC) and High Throughput computing (HTC) along with evolutionary and adaptive algorithmic techniques are the enablers of computational science. <br>

Considering the above broad outline, the International Symposium on Computational Science- ISCSâ€™15 is being organized from 12 to 15 December 2015 at SSSIHL to dwell on some of the topics and practices. The objective is to bring interested individuals, active researchers, patrons and practitioners together in one platform to deliberate on the recent happenings in some of these areas. The symposium also includes a few tutorials to impart knowledge, experience and exposure to the participants on some of the important areas that influence computational science</p>
