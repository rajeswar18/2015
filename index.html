<h3 style="text-align:center; color:#333399;"> Aim and  Objective </h3>
		
<p>Computational Science is the study of addressing problems that are impossible to solve (or difficult to solve) without computing support. The field is interdisciplinary by nature and includes the use of advanced computing capabilities to understand and solve complex problems. In short, Computational Science is the science of using computers to do science.  </p>

<p>Computational techniques enables simulation of natural phenomena at different scales. Such multi-scale, multi-level  simulations have enabled many recent discoveries leading to  better understanding of the nature. There is a strong need to  pursue this path of doing science, the third pillar of scientific  investigations. Computational Science also involves the 
application of data-analytics tools and algorithms, mathematical  modelling and simulation techniques to the study of natural 
phenomena.  </p>

<p> Computational Intelligence which is the study of computational  methods in ways that exhibit intelligence and methods that 
adapt to changing environments and changing goals is another area of interest to do Computational Science. High performance computing (HPC) and High Throughput computing (HTC) along with evolutionary and adaptive algorithmic techniques are the 
enablers of computational science. </p>

<p> Considering the above broad outline, the <b>International Symposium on Computational Science- ISCS’15 </b> is being organized from 12 to 15 December 2015  at SSSIHL to dwell on some of the topics and practices. The objective is to bring interested individuals, active researchers, patrons and practitioners together in one platform to deliberate on the recent happenings in some of these areas. The symposium also includes a few tutorials to impart knowledge, experience and exposure to the participants on some of the important areas that influence computational science</p>

<p> Going by the philosophy of our Institution, the participants <b>will not be charged for registration and accommodation.</b></p>

<h3>DMACS, SSSIHL</h3>
