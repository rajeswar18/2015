<br>

<p><b>Biography:</b>Pradeep Gupta is a Lead HPC & Deep Learning Solutions Architect at NVIDIA, where he supports customers and developers across Asia Pacific, Japan and India regions for Deep Learning and HPC application development. Pradeep also works to enable the GPU computing ecosystem in universities and research labs across region. Pradeep is also responsible for running and managing R&D Projects at NVIDIA Technology Centre at Singapore. He is working on smart cities enablement with GPU computing initiative in NVIDIA. Before joining NVIDIA, Pradeep had worked with various technologies in High Performance Computing domains. Pradeep received a Master's degree in research from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. </p>

<strong> Abstract</strong> <br>

<p>NVIDIA GPUs are powering a revolution in machine learning. With the rise of deep learning algorithms, in particular deep convolutional neural networks, computers are learning to see, hear, and understand the world around us in ways never before possible. Image recognition and detection systems are getting close to human-level performance. I will explain what deep learning is, and how deep learning enables scientists to automatically process image data. I will also introduce basics of GPU computing why they are good fit for Deep Neural networks. NVIDIA's recently released cuDNN library v3, DIGITS 2.0 and Depp learning education, I will try to cover all of them. This talk will help developers on how they can apply GPU based DL framework DIGITS to solve their own research problems and quickly start working on application.</p>

<strong>Prof Kishore Kotapally</strong>&nbsp;
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Associate Professor, IIIT  Hyderabad, India</p>
<br>
<p> <b>Biography:</b> Kishore Kothapalli is presently an Associate Professor at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad where he is working since 2006. Prior to that, he obtained his doctoral degree in Computer Science from the Johns Hopkins University, and his Masters degree in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. His current research interests are in  parallel and distributed algorithms with focus on graphs and matrices.</p>

<strong> Abstract</strong> <br>
<p> Graph algorithms have been at the forefront of computing research because of their immense applications to various diverse fields from sciences and engineering. The advent of parallelism and modern computer architectures in the past decade furthered the interest in graph algorithms that are also practically efficient. Several approaches and algorithms are designed for various problems such as connected components, shortest paths, betweenness centrality, subgraph identification, and the like. In most of these cases, algorithmic implications of certain structural properties of real world graphs are used to improve the behaviour of the algorithm on such graphs. </p>
<p>In this talk, we will briefly study some of the structural properties of real-world graphs. This is followed by understanding the implications of such properties on algorithms, especially in the parallel setting. We will use case studies such as biconnected components, shortest paths, and the like. The talk will review some of the recent developments on these problems. The talk ends with exciting future possibilities in this broad area. </p>
